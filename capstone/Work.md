## What I did today :

Searched about React Native and made simple weather app using current location for practice.

### React Native

`npm install react-native`

To get current location : 

```bash
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        this.setState(
          {isLoaded: true}
        )
      },
```

### Development tool
+ [Expo Snack](https://expo.io/tools)

`npm i expo` 
The expo package is an umbrella package that contains the client-side code (ex: JavaScript) for accessing system functionality such as contacts, camera, and location in Expo apps.
